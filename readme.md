![What is Keylogger?](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cnpFOb-IZns/XcTE6a4YCjI/AAAAAAAAFTc/fRgGbYjWPCI0afvPRaug2nnFi1ycUo1PQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Keylogger%2BInfographic.png)

## Introduction

This project is about creating a keylogger, a malicious computer program that records everything you type on the keyboard. It can learn the keystroke patterns including words, characters, symbols, and send all the recorded details to the malicious hackers.

## Types of Keyloggers

- **Hardware Keyloggers:** Devices that can be attached to a computer which will act as a keylogger and collect information about the specified target.
- **Software Keyloggers:** Malicious programs that do not infect your system but can still steal your passwords, account details, etc.

## How Keyloggers Work

Just like any other malicious program that sends reports to the attackers, keyloggers also send information about keystrokes that a victim enters in their keyboard to its creator or a remote server or a specified email address.

## How to Protect From Keyloggers

- Do not download attachments from unknown websites.
- Keep your AntiVirus software updated.
- Use Virtual Keyboards to prevent typing keystrokes.
- Use Two-Factor Authentication Methods on important sites.
- Use firewall and password manager.
